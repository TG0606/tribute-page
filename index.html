      <h3 id="headline">Here's a time line of Chadwick Boseman's life:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>1995</strong> - Boseman graduated from T. L. Hanna High School in 1995. In his junior year, he wrote his first play, Crossroads, and staged it at the school after a classmate was shot and killed. Boseman attended college at Howard
          University in Washington, D.C., graduating in 2000 with a Bachelor of Fine Arts in directing. One of his teachers was Phylicia Rashad, who became a mentor. She helped raise funds, notably from her friend and prominent actor Denzel
          Washington, so that Boseman and some classmates could attend the Oxford Mid-Summer Program of the British American Drama Academy in London, to which they had been accepted.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>2002</strong> - Boseman acted on stage in multiple productions, winning an AUDELCO award in 2002, and he also directed and wrote plays. He got his first television role in 2003, in an episode of Third Watch. That same year, Boseman
          portrayed Reggie Montgomery in the daytime soap opera All My Children, but stated that he was fired after voicing concerns to producers about racist stereotypes in the script.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>2008</strong> - He lived in Brooklyn at the start of his career. Boseman worked as the drama instructor in the Schomburg Junior Scholars Program, housed at the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture in Harlem, New York.

          <strong>2016</strong> - Boseman starred as Thoth, a deity from Egyptian mythology, in Gods of Egypt. Boseman was one of the few actors of color featured in the film, which had drawn criticism for depicting a predominantly white cast playing
